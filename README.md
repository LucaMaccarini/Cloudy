Weather site!

I created a little report containing all the info and design choices of the web app (only italian language) here: https://bit.ly/3RLVrsa

all the credentials or api key used are "useless" accounts or free api so I left them in the source code

to see how this web app looks like, it is running here: https://cloudy-7o5q.onrender.com
the onrender server is free and on the first requests it boots up, so the first request takes a while
