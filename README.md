Responsive and high-performance weather site!

project made for a university exam.

I created a little report containing all the info and design choices of the web app (only italian language) https://bit.ly/3RLVrsa

all the credentials or api key used are "useless" accounts or free api so I left them in the source code

to see how this web app looks like, it is hosted at this link https://cloudy-7o5q.onrender.com

## For info on the project see The linked report
