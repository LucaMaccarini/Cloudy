# Cloudy

High performance weather site!

all the information and considerations on the performances of this project have been written in Italian in the file available at this link: https://bit.ly/3RLVrsa

all the credentials or api keys used are "useless" accounts or free api so I left them in the source code

To see how this web application looks like, it runs here: https://cloudy-7o5q.onrender.com
the server onrender is free and really bad in performance... on the first request received after a period of inactivity it takes a lot to respond because it wakes up the entire web app that is spent after a period of inactivity
